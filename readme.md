This is a simple task manager application built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks. The application is developed using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Node.js.

The backend of this application is developed by me, while the frontend code is adapted from the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel.
